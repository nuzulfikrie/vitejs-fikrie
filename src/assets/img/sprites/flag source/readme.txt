Including 5 different sizes of all country flags would result in tremendous amounts of CSS.
To reduce bloat only a handful of flags and their sprite/css have been added to the theme in icons.less

Those wishing to add additional flags must recreate the sprite from their chosen flags and update the corresponding css in icons.less
Each flag icon should have its css prefixed with ".flag-" and its width/height should be set to match a given size(16px, 24px, 32px, etc)

Many online sprite and css generators are available free of charge and can greatly help with this task. Such as http://css.spritegen.com/

If you need further help adding your own flags please contact support and they guide you through the process.
